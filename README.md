# Motivational-quote-page.
Welcome to the Daily Quotes Card Flip project! This is a dynamic web application that displays motivational quotes using a CSS flip card effect. The project demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and visually appealing user interface.

Features
Card Flip Animation: A smooth CSS-based flip animation reveals different motivational quotes on the front and back of the card.
Dynamic Quotes: Quotes are fetched from a text file, ensuring fresh content every time the page is loaded or the card is flipped.
Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring it looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
User Interaction: Click on the card to flip and see new quotes each time.
Technologies Used
HTML: Structure of the webpage.
CSS: Styling and animations for the flip card and overall design.
JavaScript: Fetching quotes from a text file and updating the card content dynamically.
Fetch API: For retrieving quotes from a text file.
How It Works
Fetch Quotes: Quotes are retrieved from a text file hosted on the server. Each line of the file represents a different quote.
Display Quotes: The front and back of the card are populated with random quotes upon page load.
Flip Effect: The card flips when hovered over, showing the back side with a new quote and allowing users to interact with it.
